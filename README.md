## üèó Architecture

Healix follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Healix.API**: Presentation layer with controllers and middleware
- **Healix.Application**: Business logic layer with CQRS handlers and services  
- **Healix.Domain**: Core domain entities, value objects, and business rules
- **Healix.Infrastructure**: Data access, external services, and infrastructure concerns

### Key Patterns Implemented
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write operations
- **Mediator Pattern**: Decoupled request/response handling using MediatR
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer
- **Specification Pattern**: Encapsulated business rules and queries
